        <p class="ABp">Welcome to my personal blog! I'm Nathan, and I've 
            gone through many iterations with this blog, from Blogger to WordPress and beyond. I've now decided to start this webpage from scratch. While I may not be a CSS guru, I hope you can look past that and still enjoy the content I share here.
        </p>
        <p class="ABp">
            Currently, I'm in my junior year pursuing a bachelor's degree in Network Engineering and Security at Western Governors University. I hold certifications in CompTIA A+, CompTIA Security+, LPI Linux Essentials, and ITILv4, and I'm currently working towards the Cisco Certified Network Associate certification. My primary interests within the vast realm of technology and information systems lie in networking and cybersecurity, as you'll see reflected in the articles on this blog.  
        </p>
        <p class="ABp">
            I'm based in my hometown of Colorado Springs, Colorado, where I love to travel, exploring different cultures and architectures. I'm also deeply enthusiastic about music, art, and science. My dog, Neptune, named after one of my favorite planets, accompanies me on many of my adventures, as you can see in this picture from one of our walks.

            In my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends and family, as well as delving into anything STEM-related. If you'd like to discuss technology or have suggestions for page layout or future blogs, please don't hesitate to contact me using the information provided in the "Contact Me" navigation link above.
